# What a nice day

Given a non-empty string s and a list wordList containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

For example, given

s = "whataniceday",

wordList = ["a", "what", "an", "nice", "day"].

Return true because "whataniceday" can be segmented as "what a nice day".

Words from the dictionary may be used multiple times.
