# Merge intervals

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals. You may assume intervals are correct, i.e. for each interval [b, e] it is assumed that b<= e.

For example, given

Intervals: [1,3],[8,10],[2,6],[15,18],[18,21]

Return [1,6], [8,10], [15,21] as overlapped intervals.
